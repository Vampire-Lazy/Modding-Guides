# Modding Guides

Modding Guides for Different Games. Here we will post guides for most the popular games. Some will be Guides as Links to other sites or just here if the links are dead. If any link is found dead, feel free to report in [issues](https://github.com/Vampire-Lazy/modding-guides/issues).

**Note: Every Guide is made for specific version of games, so 1st check and verify if you got the same version of game as game version guide then good, else check for different version which matches with yours.**
