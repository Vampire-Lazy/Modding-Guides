**“***San Andreas is shocking, not necessarily because of its typically contentious subject matter (though there's plenty in it to rub those of a conservative disposition the wrong way) but because of the sheer scale of the experience...* **Is it really the best game ever made?** *Quite possibly, yes.***”** — John Davison, *1Up.com*.

**Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas** is a [Rockstar North](https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Rockstar_North)-developed video game released on 26th October [2004](https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/2004) by [Rockstar Games](https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Rockstar_Games), and is the seventh title in the [*Grand Theft Auto*](https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto) series and the third game in the [3D Universe](https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/3D_Universe) of the series. It is the sequel to [*Grand Theft Auto: Vice City*](https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto:_Vice_City) and the prequel to [*Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories*](https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto:_Liberty_City_Stories) and [*Grand Theft Auto III*](https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_III). It was released on the same date as [*Grand Theft Auto Advance*](https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_Advance). *GTA San Andreas* is set in the fictional state of [San Andreas](https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/San_Andreas_(3D_Universe)).

By far the largest and most complex playing field of any [3D Universe](https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/3D_Universe) game, San Andreas consists of three fully-realized cities: [Los Santos](https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Los_Santos_(3D_Universe)), [San Fierro](https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/San_Fierro_(3D_Universe)) and [Las Venturas](https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Las_Venturas_(3D_Universe)), and includes vast expanses of countryside, forests, a desert, and even a mountain and many hills. The game is centered around the return of [Carl Johnson](https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Carl_Johnson) (also known as CJ) to his gang (the [Grove Street Families](https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Grove_Street_Families)), and their subsequent return to power.

On November 11, [2021](https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/2021), the game was re-released on 8th and 9th generation consoles in honor of *Grand Theft Auto III*'s 20-year anniversary under the title *Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas - The Definitive Edition*, included in the [*Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition*](https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto:_The_Trilogy_-_The_Definitive_Edition) bundle.
