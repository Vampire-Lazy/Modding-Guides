# Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas

**Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas** is a 2004 [action-adventure game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action-adventure_game) developed by [Rockstar North](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockstar_North) and published by [Rockstar Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockstar_Games). It is the fifth main entry in the [*Grand Theft Auto* series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto), following 2002's [*Grand Theft Auto: Vice City*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto:_Vice_City), and the seventh installment overall. It was released in October 2004 for the [PlayStation 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_2), in June 2005 for [Microsoft Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows) and [Xbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_(console)), and in November 2010 for [Mac OS X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X). The game is set within an [open world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_world) environment that players can explore and interact with at their leisure. The story follows former gangster [Carl "CJ" Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Johnson_(Grand_Theft_Auto)), who returns home following his mother's murder and is drawn back into his former gang and a life of crime while clashing with corrupt authorities and powerful criminals. Carl's journey takes him across the fictional U.S. state of San Andreas, which is heavily based on [California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California) and [Nevada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada) and encompasses three major cities: Los Santos (inspired by [Los Angeles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles)), San Fierro ([San Francisco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco)) and Las Venturas ([Las Vegas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas)).

The game features references to many real-life elements of the world, such as its cities, regions, and landmarks, with its plot heavily based on several real-life events in Los Angeles in the early 1990s, including the rivalry between real-life [street gangs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_gang), the [crack epidemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crack_epidemic) of the 1980s and early 1990s, the [LAPD Rampart scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rampart_scandal), and the [1992 Los Angeles riots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_Los_Angeles_riots). Unlike its predecessor, *San Andreas* introduced gameplay elements that were incorporated in later games, including [RPG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_video_game)-style mechanics, customisation options with both clothing and vehicle appearances, a vast array of activities and mini-games, and the inclusion of [gambling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling) games.

Considered by many reviewers to be one of the [greatest video games ever made](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_games_considered_the_best), *San Andreas* received critical acclaim upon release, with praise directed at its music, story and gameplay, and criticism for its graphics and some aspects of its controls. It was the best-selling video game of 2004, and with over 27.5 million copies sold worldwide as of 2011, it is the [best-selling PlayStation 2 game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_PlayStation_2_video_games) and one of the [best-selling video games of all time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best-selling_video_games_of_all_time). Like its predecessors, *San Andreas* is cited as a landmark in video games for its far-reaching influence within the industry. The game's violence and sexual content was the source of much public concern and controversy. In particular, a player-made software patch, dubbed the "[Hot Coffee mod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_Coffee_mod)", unlocked a previously hidden sexual scene, resulting in the game being re-rated AO by the North American [Entertainment Software Rating Board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Software_Rating_Board) (although its previous M rating was reinstated after the game was edited to remove the content). A [remastered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_remaster) version of the game was released for [Android](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(system)) and [iOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS) in 2013, for [Windows Phone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Phone), [Fire OS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_OS) and [Xbox 360](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360) in 2014, and for [PlayStation 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_3) in 2015. In June 2018, the game was made available for the [Xbox One](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_One) via [backward compatibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_backward-compatible_games_for_Xbox_One_and_Series_X). An enhanced version with the subtitle [*The Definitive Edition*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto:_The_Trilogy_%E2%80%93_The_Definitive_Edition) was released in 2021, and a [virtual reality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality) version for [Oculus Quest 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oculus_Quest_2) is in development. The next main entry in the series, [*Grand Theft Auto IV*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_IV), was released in April 2008.
