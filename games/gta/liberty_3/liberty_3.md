**“***One of the most influential and successful games ever made.***”** -The New York Times

**Grand Theft Auto III** (also shortened into **GTA III** or **GTA 3**) is a 2001 action-adventure videogame developed by [Rockstar North](https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Rockstar_North) (then known as DMA Design) and published by [Rockstar Games](https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Rockstar_Games). It was originally released for the [PlayStation 2](https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/PlayStation_2) console, but also saw ports for the [PC](https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/PC) and [Xbox](https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Xbox_(console)).

Set in the fictional [Liberty City](https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Liberty_City_(3D_Universe)) in 2001, *Grand Theft Auto III* begins a new [continuity](https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/3D_Universe) separated from its [prede](https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_(1997_game))[cessors](https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_2). The game's narrative follows the adventures of [Claude](https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Claude), a silent criminal who was betrayed by his girlfriend [Catalina](https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Catalina) during a bank heist. Claude begins to work for different factions in the crime-riddled Liberty City, including the [Mafia](https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Mafia), [Yakuza](https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Yakuza) and corrupted figures.

Set in an open-world environment, *Grand Theft Auto III* is the first game in the series to be presented in a fully 3D world, shifting away from the [top-down perspective](https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Top-Down_Perspective) that characterized previous games in the franchise. Development was handled by DMA Design, and it was the final game developed by the company before its rename into Rockstar North.

*Grand Theft Auto III* was universally acclaimed upon its release in October 2001. Critics praised the game for its presentation, game design, freedom, sound design and ambition, though it was a subject of controversy due to its violent nature. Multiple publications deemed it a revolutionary title for its advancements in game design and open-ended gameplay, and it was awarded a variety of end-year accolades. A commercial success, *GTA 3* sold over 14 million copies.

In 2011, the game was re-released on [iOS](https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/IOS) and [Android](https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Android) devices for its 10-year anniversary under the title *Grand Theft Auto III: 10 Year Anniversary Edition*. It was met with positive responses, with gaming publications praising its visuals, though criticism was directed at the port's controls.

On November 11, [2021](https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/2021), the game was re-released on 8th and 9th generation consoles for its 20-year anniversary under the title *Grand Theft Auto III - The Definitive Edition*, included in the [*Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition*](https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto:_The_Trilogy_-_The_Definitive_Edition) bundle.
