# Grand Theft Auto

The *Grand Theft Auto* series is split into separate [fictional universes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictional_universe), named after the primary level of graphics capability used in each era. The original [*Grand Theft Auto*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_(video_game)), its expansions and its sequel are considered the "2D universe". [*Grand Theft Auto III*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_III) and its sequels are considered the "3D universe". [*Grand Theft Auto IV*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_IV), its expansions and [*Grand Theft Auto V*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_V) are considered the "HD universe". Each universe is considered separate with only brands, place names and background characters shared between them.

[*Grand Theft Auto*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_(video_game)), the first game in the series, was released for [Microsoft Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows) and [MS-DOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS) in November 1997, ported to the [PlayStation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_(console)) in 1998 and the [Game Boy Color](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Color) in 1999. [*Grand Theft Auto 2*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_2) was released in 1999 for Microsoft Windows, later receiving ports on the PlayStation, [Dreamcast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreamcast) and Game Boy Color.

The [PlayStation 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_2) also featured three instalments of the main series, all of which have been re-released on several platforms; a deal between [Take-Two Interactive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Take-Two_Interactive) and [Sony Computer Entertainment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Computer_Entertainment) resulted in their timed exclusivity on the PlayStation 2, before receiving ports to Microsoft Windows and the [Xbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_(console)). The 2001 title [*Grand Theft Auto III*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_III) moved away from the [two-dimension (2D) graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2D_computer_graphics) used in the first two games to [three-dimension (3D) computer graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_computer_graphics). [*Grand Theft Auto: Vice City*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto:_Vice_City) was published in 2002, and was the first to feature a speaking protagonist, voiced by [Ray Liotta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Liotta). [*Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto:_San_Andreas), released in 2004, introduced various new elements, including character customisation and a large map encompassing three cities and surrounding rural area.

Two main instalments were published for the [PlayStation 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_3) and [Xbox 360](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360). The 2008 title *Grand Theft Auto IV* focused on realism and detail, removing various customisation features, while adding an [online multiplayer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_multiplayer) mode. [*Grand Theft Auto V*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_V), published in 2013, featured three playable protagonists. It was released to massive financial success, breaking multiple records. It was later [re-released](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_V_(re-release)) with various enhancements, in 2014 for the [PlayStation 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_4) and [Xbox One](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_One), and in 2015 for Microsoft Windows; versions for [PlayStation 5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_5) and [Xbox Series X and S](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_Series_X_and_S) were released in March 2022.

On 4 February 2022, Rockstar confirmed that development of [a new entry in the series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Untitled_Grand_Theft_Auto_game) was "well underway". In-development footage of the game leaked in September 2022; Rockstar noted that it was "extremely disappointed" by the manner in which the game was first demonstrated, but that it did not anticipate long-term effects on development.
