**“***The depth of this game is unparalleled; there are hordes of side quests and missions and cool little easter eggs. You need to follow the main story in order to open up the whole city and gain access to property acquisition, but you can still spend hours just wandering around getting into trouble.***”** — Ben Silverman, *Game Revolution*.

**Grand Theft Auto: Vice City** (also referred to as **GTA Vice City***,* **Vice City** *and abbreviated* **GTAVC**) is a video game developed by [Rockstar North](https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Rockstar_North). It is the fifth installment in the [*Grand Theft Auto*](https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto) series and the second game in the [3D Universe](https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/3D_Universe) timeline of the series.

The game is set in [Vice City](https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Vice_City_(3D_Universe)), [Florida](https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/State_of_Florida), in [1986](https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/1986), and concerns the exploits of protagonist [Tommy Vercetti](https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Tommy_Vercetti) as he rises to become Vice City's major criminal power. The game's events follow on from [*Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories*](https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto:_Vice_City_Stories).

Designed by [Rockstar North](https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Rockstar_North) and published by [Rockstar Games](https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Rockstar_Games), it debuted in North America on October 27, [2002](https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/2002) for [PlayStation 2](https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/PlayStation_2) and quickly became the best-selling video game of the year. Following this success, *GTA Vice City* saw releases in [Europe](https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Europe), [Australia](https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Australia) and Japan, and became available on [PC](https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/PC) and [Xbox](https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Xbox_(console)). Later, [Rockstar Vienna](https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Rockstar_Vienna) packaged the game with its predecessor, *GTA III*, and sold it as the [*Grand Theft Auto: Double Pack*](https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto:_Double_Pack) for Xbox, and finally it debuted for [iOS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iOS) and [Android](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)) December 6, 2012 as a celebration of its 10-year anniversary. As of April [2015](https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/2015), *GTA Vice City* is the fourth best-selling PlayStation 2 game of all time in the United States. *GTA Vice City* also appeared on the [Japanese](https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Japan) magazine Famitsu's readers' list of 100 all-time favorite videogames in 2006.

Its original release version uses a tweaked version of the [RenderWare](https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/RenderWare) game engine used by *GTA III*, and similarly presents a huge cityscape, fully populated with buildings (from hotels to skyscrapers), vehicles (cars, motorcycles, boats, helicopters, and planes) and people.

On November 11, [2021](https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/2021), the game was re-released on 8th and 9th generation consoles in honor of *Grand Theft Auto III*'s 20-year anniversary under the title *Grand Theft Auto: Vice City - The Definitive Edition*, included in the [*Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition*](https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto:_The_Trilogy_-_The_Definitive_Edition) bundle.
